<h1>Network Tracker using Wireshark and Python</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>
For this project, I created a Network Tracker using the packet analyser Wireshark, some Python code and Google Maps. This project demonstrates the implementation steps needed to take a network traffic file and convert it into a visual representation using Google Maps.
<br />

<h2>Environments and Languages Used</h2>

- <b>Wireshark</b>
- <b>Python</b>
- <b>Google Maps</b>
